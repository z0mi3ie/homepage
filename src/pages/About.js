                Thank you for checking out my space of the web!

                I have been a Software Engineer for about 8 years after graduating the University
                of New Hampshire for Computer Science, but I have been
                programming almost my whole life. When I was in 4th grade I bought Interplay's
                Learn to Program Basic CD-ROM pack from the Scholastic Book Club. After spending
                weeks going through it I wanted to branch out -- then I discovered QBasic and online
                tutorials. I was hooked.
                <br />
                <br />

                Outside of programming, I have a few other hobbies.
                <br />
                <br />

                I watch too many 70s/80s/90s Horror, SciFi, and B-Movies.
                <br />
                <br />

                I love gaming, especially Dark Souls and Bloodborne. I'm working at getting all
                achievements across all the FromSoft SoulsBorne games. Getting there!
                <br />
                <br />

                For my non-screen related hobbies, I like to paint miniatures and build models. I'm
                trying to be better about consitently posting my attempts at them on Instagram.
